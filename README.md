# RGN-Discord-Bot
Jasmine 1:
I researched some resources for the python and javascript library. Bk and I do not have much experience with either. We came to the conclusion Python may be the easiest for beginners.
We found the discord.py documentation. I shared this with BK and he followed the tutorial on this for the beginner hello bot. Link to tutorial: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
I followed a similar tutorial from youtube for my a personal discord server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCiqcu2NP8I&list=PL-7Dfw57ZZVRB4N7VWPjmT0Q-2FIMNBMP&ab_channel=JamesS

Ethan 1: Using the resources Jasmin provided, I made a mock bot to get a feel for how it works. To do so, I made a new bot in the discord applications menu and had to tune what permissions the bot needed like being able to read messages. After making the bot settings, I then invited it to the discord server being used for the project. I then followed a guide for a simple bot, which I ran into the issue of actually getting it to work for a bit. After realizing I goofily forgot to put in the token for the bot into the program, I got it to work with basic "Hello" responses. 

Jasmine 2: I'm having a lot of trouble forking the github and getting my code onto the forked branched. I have googled commands and am trying to pull and then push, however I haven't worked with branches much. 

Jasmine 3: I deleted the last fork I made and saved my work to a notepad file just in case. I then reforked and cloned the repo using the fork url. It seems to be working well. Added the new token and the synced. I tested the new user post welcome message and give an API response which was a random joke API in this case, however the API doesn't seem to be working. Realized I had to hit subscribe in the free API interface.
