# RGN-Discord-Bot
Jasmine:
I researched some resources for the python and javascript library. Bk and I do not have much experience with either. We came to the conclusion Python may be the easiest for beginners.
We found the discord.py documentation. I shared this with BK and he followed the tutorial on this for the beginner hello bot. Link to tutorial: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
I followed a similar tutorial from youtube for my a personal discord server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCiqcu2NP8I&list=PL-7Dfw57ZZVRB4N7VWPjmT0Q-2FIMNBMP&ab_channel=JamesS
